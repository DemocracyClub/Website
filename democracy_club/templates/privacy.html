## Privacy

This site is run by Democracy Club Community Interest Company. We are a UK-registered not-for-profit dedicated to
providing opportunities for greater democratic engagement. Our registered office address is Democracy Club,
Spacehoppers, New Mills, Libbys Drive, Stroud, GL5 1RN.

In a nutshell, we care about your privacy. We collect data to see how people use our sites so that we can improve them.
We don’t carry adverts, and we don’t sell your data.

## Privacy, in detail

### Why do we collect data?

The law says we must have a ‘lawful purpose’ to collect personal data. We collect and process personal information
either because we have your explicit consent to do so or because we have a legitimate interest in improving our
services.

Democracy Club CIC runs several digital services whose purpose is to increase democratic engagement, as well as
secondary services that indirectly serve those aims, such as a crowdsourcing database, an email list and an online chat
space. These services or tools are made more useful or can only exist as a result of personal data being shared with us.

### What data do we collect?

When you use any of our services, we may store your IP
address ([a unique identifier for your device or internet connection](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address))
in order to understand how our websites are used and to help with some parts of our server administration.

If you sign up to any of our services, such as a mailing list, we collect the data you provide so
that we can keep in touch and provide you with relevant information.

If you sign up to help crowdsource data, we will store your username and email address. The edits you make will be
publicly recorded alongside your username, which, depending on the username you choose, may allow you to be identified
personally. If you have chosen an anonymous username, Democracy Club administrators will be able to see the email
address linked to it.

Several of our services provide information to you based on your postcode. We store your postcode so we can produce
anonymised statistics, such as when we total up the number of users in an area. For example, we
made [this table](https://democracyclub.github.io/wheredoivote-usage-may-2018/data/wheredoivote-usage-may-2018) of users
in a council area.

### Do we share information with others?

The personal data we collect on candidates becomes open data available to anyone to increase democratic engagement.

If you sign up for our online chat, Slack, you’ll be subject to
their [privacy policy](https://slack.com/privacy-policy).

Everything else, including postcode logging and server access logs are stored on our hosting provider, AWS. We only use
the `eu-west-2` AWS region, meaning data is stored in the UK. You can read more
on [how AWS process this data](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/eu-data-protection/).

Slack and AWS are US companies. They must observe the same GDPR rules when processing data from the EU.

### For how long do we keep personal data?

We keep personal data for as long as we have consent or as long as is necessary to pursue the goal of greater democratic
engagement and is consistent with the public interest.

For example, we will maintain a record of candidates as a matter of public fact, but we can remove contact details,
or information that isn't part of a public notice, on application. The nature of open data means that we can only
do this on the web properties we control.

If you sign up for one of our services, such as our mailing list, we will keep your data until you
notify us that you no longer wish to use the service.

### Cookies, tracking and third-party services

We sometimes use cookies track if you are logged in to a website. This type of cookie is ‘strictly necessary’ 
for the log-in feature to work.

We track usage of our services so that we can see how people are using it, what pages people are looking at and so on in
order to improve the service. 

We use GoatCounter to do this. It does not identify you personally. You can read more about 
[GoatCounter's GDPR policy](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/gdpr) and their 
[privacy policy](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/privacy).

### Your rights

You can ask to see the personal data we hold for you. You can also ask us to delete it. In both cases we must respond
within one month. We will not erase data that is of a public record, such as the name of a candidate in an election.

You can ask that we correct any erroneous personal data we hold about you. We will aim to do that as quickly as
possible.

You have the right to object to the use of your personal data.

### Contact us

To exercise your personal data rights or for any questions about how we process data, please
email [hello@democracyclub.org.uk](mailto:hello@democracyclub.org.uk).

If you believe that we are not observing your personal data rights, you also have the right to complain to the
Information Commissioner’s Office and potentially to a judicial remedy.
