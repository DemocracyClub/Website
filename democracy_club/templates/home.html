At the last election, YourNextMPâ€™s volunteer-sourced database of candidates was found to be <strong>more accurate</strong> than at least one of the most popular commercial datasets.

YourNextMP is already the biggest, most well sourced and well structured database of General Election 2015 candidate data. Get the data now, or help by contributing new nuggets.

The news media say a lot of interesting things about the candidates you might vote for and the constituency you live in. However, it's all buried and difficult to find.

Election Mentions presents articles that we think are relevant in an attractive and simple list, facilitating further research, and ultimately helping to inform your vote. You can also add articles you find for other people to read.
