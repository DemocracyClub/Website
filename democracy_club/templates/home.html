At the last election, YourNextMP’s volunteer-sourced database of candidates was found to be <strong>more accurate</strong> than at least one of the most popular commercial datasets.

YourNextMP is already the biggest, most well sourced and well structured database of General Election 2015 candidate data. Get the data now, or help by contributing new nuggets.
