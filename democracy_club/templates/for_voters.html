                <h3>Election Widget</h3>
                <p>You can embed our Election 'Widget' for free on on any web page.
                    The embedding process is as simple as complying and pasting some code,
                    and does not require a web developer. We have two widgets to choose from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Combined elections widget. This shows elections, candidates and polling stations to the user.</li>
                    <li>Polling station widget. This displays only the location of the user's polling place.</li>
                </ul>

                <img style="margin-top: 1rem;box-shadow: 1px 2px 4px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);"
                    src="{% static 'images/widget.png' %}" alt="Election Widget">
