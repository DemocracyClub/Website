There’s [only a few days](https://twitter.com/DaysToElection) until the next general election.

In 2010 7,000 non-partisan volunteers [got together](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8651258.stm) as Democracy Club and got stuck in doing a range of useful, simple activities like working out who all the candidates were, and collecting information about what they thought about major issues. But it was just an experiment, and one that was started a bit too close to the election to have much impact.

In 2015 we want to do far better, and so we’re starting far earlier.  We want to form a community of people who just want the election to be better. More facts, less bluster. More issues, fewer non-stories.

If you want to be involved please let us have your [email]((https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/democracy-club)), or [follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/democlub). We need to work together to work out how to make this the best election Britain’s ever had.

## Which side are you on?

Democracy Club is non-partisan. We do not support a party. We do not receive money from any party donors. We do not take policy positions - not even on things like the age of voting. We are concerned with collating data and building tools that enable people to be better informed. 

## What happens after the election?

We imagine that there’s a role for a non-partisan organisation to continue to build tools and harness the crowd to constantly improve the state of democracy in the UK. There are also a lot more elections: local councils, devolved parliaments and assemblies, Police & Crime Commissioners, Mayoral and European elections. All of these elections could benefit from a more informed, better engaged electorate.

We see 2015 as a test run for something really big - something on a grand nationwide scale in 2020, where a better informed electorate results in a better election.

## Who are we?

We aren’t exactly an army, and we don’t have any money.

But we are a group of people who think that in these ultra-sceptical times there must be a bunch of other people out there who think that we can work together to make the next election just suck less.
