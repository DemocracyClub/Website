*If you would like to talk to us about this project, please email [pollingstations@democracyclub.org.uk](mailto:pollingstations@democracyclub.org.uk) or call Sym on [07742079314](tel:07742079314)*

We'd love you to use our polling station finder on your web site. If you do, we kindly ask that you:

1. Credit Democracy Club, linking to our home page at [https://democracyclub.org.uk/](https://democracyclub.org.uk/) along side the embedded widget.
2. Let us know you're using it. We don't limit use, but it's great to know who has used the embed feature.
3. Give us feedback either from your users or yourselves. We want to learn and iterate, and we can't do that without feedback!

To embed the site, use the following code:


    <iframe src="https://wheredoivote.co.uk/embed/"
        style="width:100%; height:1100px"
        frameborder="0"
        scrolling="no"></iframe>

## Custom designs, white label and API

If you would like something other than the default design on your pages, we can
provide a white label or custom version. For software developers we have an
[API](https://wheredoivote.co.uk/api/) that allows you to use our service in
your bespoke applications.

Please [contact us]({% url "contact"%}) for more information about this.
