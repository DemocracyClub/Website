These file downloads contain a row for each candidate per election.
The candidate's name and party are drawn from the official nomination papers.
All other information is added by Democracy Club or our volunteers.
This additional information includes geographic data, contact details,
and demographic information such as age.

Each candidate is assigned a unique ID number, allowing for candidacies
to be tracked across time.

The database covers all General Elections since 2010, all local and
devolved elections since 2016, and all by-elections since May 2017.
It does not include town or parish councils.

Please be aware that the files are updated hourly, and are liable
to undergo rapid change during busy periods.

If you have any questions or comments about our data, please [email us](mailto:hello@democracyclub.org.uk).
