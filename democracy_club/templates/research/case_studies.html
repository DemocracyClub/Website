    <h1>Case studies</h1>
    <p>Each year, our voter information tools and elections data are used by a wide array of organisations, while our expertise is often drawn upon by journalists and researchers. Below are
        some of our favourite examples.
    </p>
    <p>Our data has also been used in multiple House of Commons Library research briefings. For examples of this, please see our <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/report_2021/#press-pr">2021 election report</a>.</p>
    <p>For summaries of press coverage during individual elections, <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/projects/reports/">please see the relevant election report</a>.</p>
    <p>To access the data yourself, please see our <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/data_apis/voting_information_api/">data and API pages</a>.</p>
