<p class="ds-h4">Democracy Club strengthens democracy and civic culture in the UK.</p>

Our vision is of a country with the digital foundations to support everyone's
participation in democratic life.

Established in 2010 to collect information on the candidates running in that year's
general election, Democracy Club was registered as a Community Interest Company in
2015. Since then we have covered every major UK election, and now run the national
online polling station finder and candidate database. A data supplier to the [Electoral
Commission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ChLFQTTDED9xQ9-shu3N24PK2i4p1sW78wx3CmDiUtY/edit_)
since 2017, we have also worked with local and national government across all four
UK nations.

In our short history we have transformed the accessibility of UK elections. We've
opened up the online civic space, providing non-partisan platforms which enable
citizens to scrutinise, evaluate, and engage directly with their politicians and
candidates. We've delivered personalised election information to well over ten
million people since 2018. In a world which is increasingly concerned about the
effect of the internet on democracy, we're using digital and data to inform and
empower. [Read our current organisational strategy](https://democracyclub.org.uk/blog/2022/01/05/2022-and-beyond-an-updated-strategy/).

Working alongside other organisations is at the core of what we do. Our tools are
used widely across UK civil society, from student unions and civic education
organisations, through to technology and social and traditional media companies.
During 2019 we sent 218m notifications in partnership with Facebook, Instagram,
Twitter, and SnapChat to remind people to vote. We've also enabled groups supporting
the most marginalised to get their members engaged and voting, such as migrants,
Roma and Travellers, and people with learning disabilities and autism. Furthermore,
by making data on elections more freely available we've enabled high-quality
research and journalism - for example, The Times and the Fawcett Society have
recently used our data to shine a light on the 'glacial' progress of gender and
age diversity among election candidates.

Democracy Club is widely regarded as a core infrastructure project within the UK
democracy sector.

## How we work

Democracy Club consists of a small core team of full-time software developers,
data specialists, geospatial engineers and election experts. The team is supported
by an online network of hundreds of volunteers who assist with compiling and
maintaining our databases.

Much of our work focuses on collecting data from the UK's approximately 400 local
authorities, either via communicating with them directly or taking information
from their websites using our unique infrastructure of web 'scrapers'. Working with
our amazing volunteers, we aggregate this data and publish it for use by anyone.
We are committed to open data. We believe that making the data that we collect
available to everyone is the best way of empowering the most people to vote.

We believe that we make our greatest impact when we work in partnership with
other organisations. In the past we've collaborated with other civic organisations,
charities, and social and traditional media to reach millions more people with
information and research.

[Meet the team](/about/team/).

## Community and volunteers

Democracy Club's election candidate database is compiled and maintained by volunteers.
Our volunteers are non-partisan, either interested in democracy, open source technology,
or both. Around elections, we're supported by a network of supporters who crowdsource
publicly available information like candidate manifestos. We also host an online
community of 1,000 members and a mailing list with tens of thousands of subscribers.

The focus of this work occurs every year in March and April, when candidate lists
are published for the May local elections. We rely on our volunteers to collect
these (mainly PDF) documents and enter the information into our database, with a
little help from our automation software. In 2022, which was a relatively quiet
election, 1,500 volunteers made 64,000 edits to our database, collecting details on
over 21,000 individual candidates.

Want to take part? To get involved, [head over to our database](https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/volunteer/) to create an account.
We also recommend joining our mailing list (see form at footer) to keep updated.
