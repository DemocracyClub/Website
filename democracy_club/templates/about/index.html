<p class="ds-h4">Our vision is of a country with the digital foundations to support everyone’s participation in democratic life.</p>

_Our mission_ is to create those foundations by:

- Identifying areas for improvement in democratic engagement;
- Ensuring everyone has access to quality information on democratic processes, particularly on elections;
- Mobilising a non-partisan movement of volunteers for democracy.

Started in 2010 and a Community Interest Company since 2015, we are a small, core team of full-time software developers,
  data specialists, geospatial engineers and election experts. Working with our community of online volunteers, we
  deliver free, simple and practical services.

We want as many people as possible to benefit from our work:

- On election days, we collaborate with Facebook, Twitter and Google. Each year we process millions of postcode searches,
  helping people find out when and where to vote.
- We provide APIs, embeddable widgets and research data to a range of partners across the political spectrum who share our
  values, from charities and think tanks to news sites and the House of Commons Library.
- We also build and maintain services people can use directly, like [WhoCanIVoteFor](https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/)
  and [WhereDoIVote](https://wheredoivote.co.uk).
- We work with different parts of the UK government, like the Electoral Commission, to help them provide election information.

Our impact is both direct and indirect. Directly, we have helped millions of people access election and local
  government information online. Indirectly, we have extensive anecdotal evidence that more people take part in
  public life as a result of Democracy Club's efforts. Our work has been covered by most national news outlets, as well as in local media across the four nations of the UK.

Building and maintaining Democracy Club's services is a long-term commitment - elections happen throughout the year
  which means we’ve got to keep our technology active and up to date at all times.

We also host an online community of more than 800 members and a mailing list with 15K subscribers. Our volunteers are non-partisan, either interested in democracy, open source technology, or both. Around elections,
  we're supported by a core team of 20 super-volunteers and a community of 300+ supporters to crowdsource publicly
  available information like candidate manifestos.


## How we work

Our core team works with local councils, organisations and individuals to collect information about elections and
  local government relating to over 400 organisations across the UK.

Although much of this data is already published and available to the public, it is rarely accessable, is often hard for computers to
  read and use, and is never brought together in a single place.

Having compiled this data, the core team makes sure all the information is accurate. Laws and regulations around public life and elections are highly complex. Getting things wrong undermines people's
  trust and risks breaking the law.

We're obsessive about getting it right.

Finally, our software developers standardise and repackage it, making the information accessible for computers, charities and individuals alike.
