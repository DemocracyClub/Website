In order to ensure that we achieve the greatest impact during these elections, we’re seeking a fixed-term Elections Assistant to help with the administration and dissemination of our voter information tools. Although this role will touch upon all regions of the UK, it will involve a specific focus on the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Parliament/Senedd Cymru."

## Future roles

Democracy Club is made up of lots of people doing things to make democracy work better.

* Python or frontend developers
* Designers
* User researchers
* Community organisers
* Fundraisers
* Evaluation people
* General mucker-inners (events, admin, finance, comms)
