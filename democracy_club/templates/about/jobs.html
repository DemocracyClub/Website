	"description": "2021 will see one of the largest and most complex sets of elections the UK has ever experienced: local elections in England; Police and Crime Commissioners in England and Wales; the Greater London Authority; and the devolved parliaments of Scotland and Wales. In order to ensure that we achieve the greatest impact during these elections, we’re seeking a fixed-term Elections Assistant to help with the administration and dissemination of our voter information tools. Although this role will touch upon all regions of the UK, it will involve a specific focus on the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Parliament/Senedd Cymru."

## Future roles

Democracy Club is made up of lots of people doing things to make democracy work better.
Most give their time voluntarily, because they love democracy. Hurray!

We also have a small staff team. We're not currently hiring, but in the past we've been known to look for:

* Python or frontend developers
* Designers
* User researchers
* Community organisers
* Fundraisers
* Evaluation people
* General mucker-inners (events, admin, finance, comms)

If you'd like to hear about future roles, do join the mailing list (below) —
