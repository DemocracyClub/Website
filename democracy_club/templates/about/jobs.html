## Future roles

Democracy Club is made up of lots of people doing things to make democracy work better.
Most give their time voluntarily, because they love democracy. Hurray!

We also have a small staff team. We're not currently hiring, but in the past we've been known to look for:

* Python or frontend developers
* Designers
* User researchers
* Community organisers
* Fundraisers
* Evaluation people
* General mucker-inners (events, admin, finance, comms)

If you'd like to hear about future roles, do join the mailing list (below) â€”
or [get in touch]({% url "contact" %}).
