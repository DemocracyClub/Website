In order to ensure that we achieve the greatest impact during these elections, we’re seeking a fixed-term Elections Assistant to help with the administration and dissemination of our voter information tools. Although this role will touch upon all regions of the UK, it will involve a specific focus on the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Parliament/Senedd Cymru."

## Chief operating officer

### About the role
We are an ambitious team of software developers, data specialists, geospatial engineers and election experts with a strong digital delivery focus.

The successful applicant will be driven to improve information about local governments in the UK. They will lead on the organisation’s delivery, sustainability and growth.

The initial focus will be on finance and fundraising for a newly written strategy. This will involve working with the CEO and board to develop a fundraising strategy for the next few years.  This role is new to the organisation and will involve taking on responsibilities from the CEO who is currently acting as COO.
###Outcomes
In the first year of the contract, we expect the COO to have:

* designed and taken ownership of internal processes
* developed relationships with new and existing funders
* an active funding pipeline in place with some new income or grants finalised
* set up a team mentoring programme

### What skills and experience do you need?
* Passionate about digital and democracy and the space where they meet.
* Experience with managing finances
* Experience with people operations/HR
* Experience fundraising
* Experience managing a team
* Non-partisan and open about any previous political involvement
* Comfortable with home or remote working.
* We expect everyone in Democracy Club to adhere to our [code of conduct](https://democracyclub.org.uk/code-of-conduct/).
* Be comfortable working in a light agile way, with daily standups, sprint plans and open working, or have a willingness to learn.
* Have the right to work in the UK

### Responsibilities
As we are a small start up, each of us is involved in many areas of work. This role will involve close work with the whole team on most non-development based work. Specifically the role will include taking on some of the CEO and voting information manager’s work in the following areas:

* Maintaining internal policy documents and processes
* Manage cash-flow, finances and accounts
* Help with fundraising and sales
* Reporting to existing funders
* Organising quarterly board and team meetings
* Helping the team plan work and ensuring delivery is running smoothly
* Managing HR functions, including team development

The ideal candidates will have experience in working in strategic and leadership roles in small organisations. Understanding of UK elections, local authorities and ‘civic tech’ is useful but not required.

We are open to adapting the role to fit the right person. This includes flexibility on working hours, and supporting learning on the job.

### Time and Money
We have a budget of £40,000 for this role, with office and hardware budget. We can be flexible on hours worked in order to give a larger pro-rata salary, depending on experience. We are offering an initial 1 year contract with optional renewal. We are flexible on work time, but are looking for a commitment of at least 3 days a week. Holiday and pension provided.

### Application Process

Your covering letter should be no more than a page and tell us why you would like to work with us and think you'd be a good fit for the role. Make sure to include your relevant skills and experience, and where you think you might need some support.

Applications will be anonymised before they are reviewed.

We encourage anyone who is interested to apply even if you don’t feel like you have all the skills required.

If you have any questions about the role or application process please get in touch with [sym.roe@democracyclub.org.uk](mailto:sym.roe@democracyclub.org.uk) who will be happy to answer questions before your application.
