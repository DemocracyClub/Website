## Funding policy
Any donations made to Democracy Club are for the sole purpose of delivering the vision of the organisation as determined by the executive and board team.

Where a donation is ‘restricted’ to a particular project, as is common with charitable grants, such projects must align with the vision of the organisation.

Democracy Club is strictly non-partisan; donations will never be used for partisan purposes.

Democracy Club will make all reasonable efforts to perform due diligence on donors who give more than £5,000. For example, although we are not a charity, we will make use of the [Know Your Donor](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/550694/Tool_6.pdf) guidelines provided by the Charities Commission.

We will publish the name of donors who give over £5,000 within a 12-month period, along with the amount given.

Democracy Club aims to be transparent in our fundraising and spending. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have concerns or questions.
