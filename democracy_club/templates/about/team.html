  <p>Building and maintaining Democracy Club's services is a long-term commitment, both in the run up to the elections
    held in May every year, and in keeping the underlying technology running year round.
  </p>
  <p>Throughout the year, we also run
    an online community of around 1,000 members and a mailing list with 15K subscribers. Our volunteers are non-partisan, either
    interested in democracy, open source technology, or both.
  </p>
  
  <p>The club is supported by a small core team and an experienced board of directors.</p>

  <h2>With thanks to</h2>

  <p>Democracy Club has been helped by many people along the way. We are grateful to them all, but some deserve a
    special mention:</p>

  <p>Seb Bacon, Tim Green, Edmund von der Burg and Tom Steinberg for their initial work in 2010, and much help from
    Michael Collins and Eleesha Taylor-Barrett since.</p>

  <p>Mark Longair for all his work on YourNextRepresentative.</p>

  <p>Andy Lulham for support, feedback and code contributions and general top wombling.</p>

  <p>Former board members Olly Benson, Rebecca Eligon, Sarah Hartley, Rebecca Kemp, Alison Walters, and Ian Watt.</p>

  <p>Chris Shaw for "being the person who cared about WhereDoIVote the most". Without him the polling station finder
    wouldn't exist, and millions of people would still be looking for their polling station to this very day.</p>

  <p>And last but not least, Joe Mitchell who took a leap in to Democracy Club, via a basement, after Sym spammed him
    once in 2014,
    and kept us afloat as co-coordinator for the best part of 5 years. He also wrote <a href="{% url "hermes_post_list" %}">almost all the blog
      posts</a>.</p>
