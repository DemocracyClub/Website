  <p>Established in 2016, our <a href="https://elections.democracyclub.org.uk/">elections database</a> underpins all our other elections projects.</p>

  <p>The database collects and holds information on every UK electoral event, including elections to all parliaments,
    principal councils, combined authorities, Police and Crime Commissioners, and council-wide governance referendums.
    It also covers all by-elections to these bodies. Weâ€™re the only organisation in the UK which collects and publishes
    this information openly.</p>

  <p>Every Election provides a unique identifier for each election, down to individual council wards. These are used as
    the building blocks upon which our other services are constructed, allowing us to tell users about upcoming
    elections with a high level of precision.</p>

  <p>The project tracks boundary changes, hosts a register of organisations that hold elections, and provides postcode look ups for elections.</p>
