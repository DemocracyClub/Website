One of the most common questions from voters on election day is “*where do I vote?*”.

<a href="https://wheredoivote.co.uk/">Our polling station finder</a> provides the answer via a simple postcode search.
  <a href="https://wheredoivote.co.uk/example">See an example result.</a>

We work with local government to establish internal best practice for publishing open data on polling stations —
which means it becomes incredibly easy for voters to find it. Voters don’t need to know which ward or
constituency they’re in or who manages their elections — we just get them the answer they’re searching for,
in seconds.

> Very clear, simple, comprehensive. It’s a wonderful voting tool and it definitely influenced positively my decision to vote. Thank you for providing such informative and easy-to-follow pre-voting platform.

The finder regularly receives over a million searches per election.
