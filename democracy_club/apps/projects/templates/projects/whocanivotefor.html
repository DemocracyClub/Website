People expect information about elections and candidates to be available online.

>I am looking for information on the candidates I am supposed to be voting for on Thursday.
I cannot find anything on either candidate. If they cannot be bothered to get the
information out there why should I bother turning out to vote???

We are making this happen. At <a href="https://whocanivotefor.co.uk">WhoCanIVoteFor.co.uk</a>, users put in their postcode and we show them everything we know.
Ideally, this information includes a statement from the candidate, their photo and contact details.

The website regularly sees half a million users during a major election. It now covers all by-elections, too.

Itâ€™s powered by our election data and our <a href="https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk">crowdsourced database of candidates</a>.
