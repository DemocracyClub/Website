Democracy Club’s annual report — 2017–2018
</figcaption>
</figure>
{# fmt:off #}

This report is a work in progress, [you can comment on the Google Documents version of
it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19K08IW6PLstuoRvKDSfKVjBMYM4zK5jZbc_wOZ_op7Y/edit#).

Democracy Club’s vision is of a society in which democracy thrives through knowledge, participation and openness.
Our mission is to use open data, design and technology to give every citizen the information and participation
opportunities they need, in a way that suits them.

We are non-partisan and we work openly. We’re a community of 12,000 club members and a small core team.

We don’t have a view of ‘the perfect democracy’. Instead, we try to make constant iterative improvements based on
citizens’ needs. We judge those needs based on publicly available research, feedback on our websites and online search
data.

This report covers our 2017/2018 ‘election year’. This is covers the 11 months after the
[2017 general election]({% url "report_2017:report_2017" %}) up to
and including the local elections on 3 May 2018. It aims to explain the effects of the club’s work.

# Summary
This year, we:

* Had polling location data for 87% of the 18+ population at the May elections
* Served 340,000 polling locations
* Crowdsourced basic details of over 16,000 candidates
* Served 489,000 candidate lookups
* Developed systems to record by-elections and their candidates
* Ran well-attended events in London, Birmingham and Manchester to crowdsource candidate data
* Created the conditions for two new organisations to use our data to encourage pre-election engagement between
candidates and voters

This year may have marked the point at which the work we do became ‘normal’. Electoral officers knew to send their
polling station data to us, local political parties knew that we’d be collecting candidate information, and media
owners or journalists knew that we would be able to provide access to election-related data.

The coverage and use of our products and data was generally greater than at any other set of scheduled local elections
we have worked on. This is our third set of scheduled local elections and the only set not to be followed by a
referendum or general election.

The task remains to expand our capacity so we can deliver on the many and varied ideas we have and that are submitted
to us, to keep improving voters’ experience of elections and to bring our approach to new areas of democratic
engagement beyond elections.

Thanks, as always, to hundreds of volunteers who put in the time to make this all possible as well as funders,
supporters and advocates of the work.

This report largely covers the levels of use of our tools and services. We are not yet able to show our impact in
terms of cognitive or behavioural change, such as enhanced trust in democracy or increased participation rates. It is
difficult to measure these outcomes, let alone prove that they were caused by our work, but we aspire to better
understand these in future.

Moreover, we are yet to precisely define the social outcomes we are trying to achieve. Should we seek to improve
turnout, knowledge, trust, community or a combination of these? Over the next year, we will aim to establish the
desired outcomes for our work with the assistance of the board, club members and anyone else who has a view. You are
warmly invited to contribute — contact details below!

# The year in data
<img src="{% static 'report_2018/images/shaun-darwood-587098-unsplash.jpg' %}" alt="">

## Elections data
### Coverage

We began our attempt to systematically record by-elections following the last general election. Between 8 June 2017
and 3 May 2018 we recorded hundreds of by-elections across district, county and unitary councils, combined
authorities, devolved assemblies and the UK Parliament. We are aware that we missed a small number of by-elections
over the summer and autumn of 2017, but are confident that since early 2018 we have been recording them all.

For 3 May 2018, we recorded scheduled elections for six mayors, 4,380 councillor posts in 2,753 wards.

Also for 3 May, we also covered the details voter ID ‘pilots’ that took place this May in five local authorities in
collaboration with the Cabinet Office. We researched the requirements of each authority (they each differed) and added
this information to the elections data.
### Partners
There were no partners who used the elections data.
### Reach/use
This dataset was used every time a postcode lookup was made via a Democracy Club service — that is, 1.1m times for
the 3 May elections.
### Analysis
Our ability to cover all elections, with more notice, is due to at least two factors. In previous years, much of this
work involved freedom of information requests and internal lobbying in order to access the critical boundary data
(i.e. so we know where the election is happening). We are delighted that since last year’s report, the Local
Government Boundary Commission for England (LGBCE) has started publishing their data under an Open Government Licence
in a timely way. This, plus our internal improvements for tracking ‘Electoral Change Orders’ has meant we are able to
add elections to our sites much earlier in the electoral cycle.

Unfortunately, official Government Statistical Service (GSS) codes for the areas with new boundaries are not published
until after elections take place. We hope to work with the Official for National Statistics (owner of the GSS codes)
and LGBCE over the next year to find a better solution to publishing identifiers for newly created boundaries in a way
that’s useful for covering elections.

Evidence from user feedback, use of the API and from Google AdWords search keywords, suggests that significant numbers
of people did not know whether they had an election on 3 May. Our websites and Your Vote Matters (the Electoral
Commission’s voter information website) provided an answer, but we might think harder about how to partner with more
organisations to use the elections data. For example, in May 2016, Buzzfeed ran an ‘election-checker’ service on their
homepage, perhaps this could have been reactivated.

Other user feedback suggested it may have been helpful to attach ‘election explainers’ to the data to help people
understand what they are voting for. This demand for explanation appears more commonly at local elections than general
elections.

Lastly, our elections data is now robust and high quality enough to allow for development of a nationwide reminders
service.
## Candidates data
### Coverage
We recorded candidates data for every scheduled election and by-election on 3 May 2018, totalling 16,106 candidates.
We also collected candidate data for every by-election we knew about outside 3 May 2018, totalling 1,231
candidates[^1].

[^1]: These numbers may include some double-counting if candidates stood in more than one election over this period.

For the May 2018 elections, we recorded at least one contact detail (any social media presence or email address) for
23.5% of the candidates. We had statements (text from the candidate explaining why voters should give them their vote)
for 8% of candidates and a photo of 14.7% of candidates.
### Partners
The following organisations used the candidates data:
The Electoral Commission via their Your Vote Matters website
We Own It, a campaign group, used it to encourage their supporters to email their candidates
End Empty Homes, a campaign group, used it to encourage candidate pledges

Previous partnerships with Facebook and Google did not recur for the local elections. Both organisations have told us
that they are unlikely to activate any election-related tools for anything other than general elections.
### Reach/use
The candidates data was used 489,000 times via the API. The data will have been used an unknown additional number of
times via third parties who downloaded the candidates data via a link on the website. CSV files of candidate data were
downloaded over 27,000 times, but only a small number of these downloads will have been by people using the data, as
opposed to automated programs.
### Analysis
Each year, Democracy Club volunteers do extraordinary work converting thousands of PDFs ever more quickly into useful
structured open data on candidates. For the local elections this year we expanded our crowdsourcing parties, running
events in London, Manchester and Birmingham, because each city had ‘all-up’ every seat elections. These events, plus
some amazing individual efforts meant that we had a complete list of candidates and their party affiliation within ten
days of the official nomination papers’ publication.

While our coverage of candidates names and party affiliation remains excellent, we are still unable to create the
depth of information that voters request. This is sometimes because local candidates do not have any online presence,
but may also be down to the limits of crowdsourcing. The 8% of candidates with statements compares poorly to the 34%
for the general election, but slightly better than the 2017 local elections.

We will continue to investigate the potential for automating more of the data collection process, perhaps by working
with local authorities or electoral management software suppliers on the names and party affiliations. This year we
also launched a <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/blog/2018/03/12/machine-learning-help-elections/">
machine-learning challenge</a> to see whether automation was possible even without any changes to the
current process. Any automation would free up volunteer time to boost the depth of candidate information.

Another approach to improving the quality or depth of the candidates information is to go via political parties. We
have long presumed that political parties have an interest in ensuring that their candidate information is online and
thus that they will be instrumental in adding candidate data. This has not always proven true. However, at the local
elections, several chairs of local parties across the political spectrum came forward to offer their own datasets
(spreadsheets), complete with contact details for their local candidates. They were not willing to enter the
information on an individual-by-individual basis due to time constraints, but were happy for us to upload their
information into our database. We do not currently have the functionality to take advantage of this, but it seems this
should be a priority for 2018-2019.


## Polling locations data
### Coverage
We were able to provide users in 126 of the 152 local authorities with scheduled elections with their polling
location. That means we covered 87% of the 18+ population in areas with a scheduled election, up from 61% at the 2017
general election.
### Partners
The data was used by: The Electoral Commission’s Your Vote Matters website, the Labour Party, and Democratic Dashboard
(a project from the London School of Economics / Democratic Audit).
### Reach/use
There were 615,995 searches for polling locations at the May elections. These were mostly served by partners via our
API.

<div class="ds-table">
<table>
<caption></caption>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Total</th>
<th>Website</th>
<th>API</th>
<th>Embed</th>

<tr>
<th>Searches</th>

<td>55.26%</td>
<td>77.08%</td>
<td>50.37%</td>
<td>87.50%</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>


The relatively high numbers of searches ‘not found’, given that we had 87% coverage, suggests that a lot of people in
areas without elections tried to use the finder. If we filter the above data to only the 152 areas with scheduled
elections:

{# fmt:off #}
We have <a href="https://democracyclub.github.io/wheredoivote-usage-may-2018/data/wheredoivote-usage-may-2018">separately
published a table</a> with the numbers of searches per local authority area.
### Analysis
This year represents a significant step forward in coverage for the polling location data. We had feared that councils
might have been less likely to provide data for a less popular election. In fact, the coverage level suggests that the
finder is now a known, trusted product and providing data is on the ‘election to-do list’ for electoral officers.

We will continue to work with the local authorities and their software suppliers to improve the process and expand the
coverage for the 2019 elections.


## Results data

### Coverage
In a first for Democracy Club, volunteers managed to collect the vote count for every candidate at the scheduled
elections
in May. Where possible, volunteers also collected turnout data, but because this is not statutorily required, many
councils do not publish it or there are differences in how councils report it.
### Partners / usage
Results data was used to power several data visualisations, such as Russ Garrett’s <a href="https://russ.garrett.co.uk/election-2018/">nationwide results map</a> and
<a href="https://odileeds.org/projects/local-elections-2018/">Open
Data Leeds’ visualisation</a> of turnout across Leeds.

We also know of anecdotal evidence that political party activists are using the data to identify significant shifts in
the vote, in order to prioritise further research or campaign efforts. We assume that all parties create their own
database of election results, but the existence of open data here saves considerable time for them all.

We Own It, the campaign group who used the candidates data to encourage candidates to support their aims, are using
the results data to identify those pledgers that have been elected, in order to hold them to account.

### Reach/use
We do not have good data on how many people this information reached. There were 340 downloads of a table of results
data, and 3,800 machine requests to an automated feed of results data, but some of these will have been our own
services.

### Analysis
The obvious value of open results data is to help voters to find out who won (or to allow a third-party to push a
notification of the results to a voter whose postcode is known). User feedback to WhoCanIVoteFor.co.uk suggests that
voters expect this information to be available overnight. Although it took several days to complete the set of
results, we have made a significant step towards ‘closing the feedback loop’ for voters here.

Results data also allows us to maintain a list of winners, who become political representatives. We can use this data
to potentially create new open data on local representatives, moving us a step closer to a goal we suggested last
year.

We also note that better turnout data would help many organisations to understand what affects turnout. We will
consider whether there is anything we can do to help make this happen.


# Apps

<img src="{% static "report_2018/images/luke-matthews-310272-unsplash.jpg" %}">

These are the voter-facing services we provide, i.e. websites and embeddable tools (the polling location widget).

## WhoCanIVoteFor.co.uk
This website allows users to enter their postcode to lookup their candidates. It was used 113,809 times by 100,100
unique users in the month up to and including 3 May.

A feedback form on the website asks whether users found what they were looking for: an average of 22% of respondents
responded positively over the month. A higher percentage of users found what they were looking for as we neared
election day: this could be because those searching nearer the day are less demanding or could have been a result of
the increased amount of local party information we attached to candidates as we got closer to the election (see next
paragraph). We aim to publish the open text box feedback in the future.

The addition of local party information, such as a twitter account, website or best, a manifesto, helped us ensure
that 11,634 candidate pages (72%) had some kind of link to information on their local party. Volunteers also found
over 500 local manifestos, which meant that 6,301 candidates (39%) could be linked to a manifesto, providing much
richer information than before. We have not broken down the feedback to see if it made a difference, but this feels
like a small step in the right direction.

For a small number of wards in London, we also displayed candidate ‘pledges’ sourced by Hope Not Hate from candidates
in a small number of wards in London. We will continue to investigate whether this presents a way to provide more
useful information on candidates.

Other data sources we displayed on the website included: hustings data (we crowdsourced the details of 134 events) and
results data, once it had been recorded.

We had some complaints from people who had been given the wrong ward for their postcode. This is because postcodes
don’t always exactly cover electoral areas, but there are more cases where it gives a wrong ward than, for example, a
wrong parliamentary constituency. This is an area we hope to focus on in the next year. We also wrote about a
<a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/blog/2017/03/20/4314-times-when-postcodes-arent-good-enough/">similar
issue on our blog</a>.

## WhereDoIVote.co.uk
This website allows users to find their polling location by entering their postcode and if necessary, their address.
It served 49,000 unique users from Monday 30 April to Thursday 3 May 2018. Of those who completed the feedback form on
the site, 96% reported that they found the site useful, up three percentage points from last year.

We made several improvements to the site based on last year’s user feedback, which seemed to positively affect the
score and this year’s feedback (e.g. the move to a single-column layout appeared to help users learn about the opening
hours of polling stations more easily).

Most of the negative feedback related to errors in postcodes or the map locations of the polling stations. We were
able to improve the data based on this feedback.

<a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/blog/2018/05/25/one-where-everyone-loves-polling-locations/">
We have published a more detailed report on the user feedback here</a>.

## Embeddable polling location finder (the&nbsp;widget)

Last year, a volunteer developed an embeddable polling location finder (or widget) that could be added to any website.
This year, we particularly encouraged councils and news sites to use it: at least 15 councils did so, including
Birmingham City Council, as well as several Trinity Mirror sites and the Evening Standard. The widget was used 25,000
times.

# Labs

<img src="{% static "report_2018/images/anjana-menon-220008-unsplash.jpg" %}">

This is the theme of work that includes anything experimental or that goes beyond elections to look more broadly at
‘democracy’.

We had listed a range of possible projects under ‘Labs’ as part of our goals for this year. Unfortunately, the only
labs idea we were able to get to was the addition of local manifestos on WhoCanIVoteFor.co.uk. The rest were beyond
our capacity this year.

For 3 May elections, we lightly piloted tailored election reminder emails to those who have requested them (users of
our websites can sign up to these with a postcode and email address). We divided up signees based upon how many
elections they had, and which type, and sent emails based on this. The lists were relatively small, but the emails
were well-received: open rates were around 50% with click-through rates varying from 11% to 27%.

## ODI Registers Report
The <a href="https://theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a> commissioned us and <a href="http://openhealthcare.org.uk/">Open Health Care</a>
to research and produce a report on collaborative
registers (our candidates lists could be understood this way).
You can <a href="https://theodi.org/article/registers-and-collaboration-making-lists-we-can-trust-report/">read it
here</a>.

One of the main findings of the report was that the governance of data is important for trust and reuse. If third
parties can’t trust data sources, they are unlikely to use them. They are more likely to trust data if there are clear
ways to report errors, or better still, contribute to the data directly in order to improve it. Democracy Club does
this in an ad-hoc way for much of our data (e.g. members of our internal chat, Slack, can alert us to things that need
fixing), or in a more formal way on our candidates site (all edits have a source, we keep each version). There is
still room for improvement in explaining how our data is governed. We might be able to share some patterns for
explaining governance as part of our improvement work.


# Club

<img src="{% static "report_2018/images/LondonSOPN.jpg" %}">

This section of the report covers the community elements of the work we do, and the financial and administrative
status of Democracy Club.

Our mailing list currently stands at just over 12,000 people. We have 46 monthly donors and we had around 400
volunteers adding data for the 3 May elections.

In late 2017 eight new non-executive directors from a range of background joined the board, to be chaired by Alice
Casey. <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/blog/2017/12/01/weve-got-board/">You can read about them via this blog
post</a>.

We currently have reserves to see us through the 2019 local elections assuming no new staff hires or general
elections. Our 2017/2018 funders were The Electoral Commission and Unbound Philanthropy at around £50,000 each.


# What’s next?
<img src="{% static "report_2018/images/gordon-williams-228787-unsplash.jpg" %}">
We will now work to set a range of goals for the next election year, have a plan in place for a snap general election
and also aim to think longer-term about our goals and our places in the civic participation ecosystem.

As the scorecard appended below shows, the goals we set for 2017/2018 were mostly achieved — if we exclude the ideas
we had for Labs — which suggests we had a relatively
good sense of what was realistic. However, there were elements left behind that clearly indicate the need for extra
resource even in the short term: growing the community and club, research and diversity.

In terms of the longer-term, the core team has spent some time considering how to grow the club via a new fundraising
effort. The effort describes how, as a first phase, we would like to expand the team to have design, research,
measurement and organising capability, with the aim to increase the quality and grow the impact of what we already do.
We then outline a second phase, describing the resources needed to go beyond our existing projects and products to
take our approach to other elements of the democratic process that need improvement. A third, more longer term, aim is
to raise money to use our knowledge to become an effective funder of democratic innovation projects in the UK.

As always, we welcome new ideas to consider or new problems to solve. We will host
<a href="https://attending.io/events/democracy-club-summer-2018-meetup">a summer get-together on Saturday
23 June in Manchester</a>: please come along with any ideas, reflections or just to hang out. Alternatively you can
